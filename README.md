# Sisters of the Road Cafe Admin and POS system

At Sisters of the Road Cafe, anyone can come in and purchase an affordable meal.
Those without the ability to afford a meal can trade volunteer time for cafe
credits. Currently, these volunteer credits are tracked manually, and the
purpose of this app is twofold:

- Provide a **Point of Sale** style interface, suitable for an iPad, for
  checking out with credits
- Provide an administrative view into volunteers' credit balances

With a system like this, the checkout process at the cafe can go more smoothly,
making running the checkout counter easier and faster. Administrators at the
cafe will be able to log into the Django Admin to look at volunteers, make
notes, and adjust balances as needed.

## Technology
