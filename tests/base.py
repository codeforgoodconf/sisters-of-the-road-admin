class CommonSubjectTestMixin:
    """Abstract mixin for test contexts revolving around a common target

    Imperative tests are intensive to read. To grok what a test is *actually*
    trying to prove requires inspecting many lines of code which are ultimately
    inessential boilerplate.

    If, instead, we group our tests by the Subject being prodded, we can cordon
    off boilerplate to a single location, leaving only the juicy bits left to
    read.

    This mixin will call a single function for every test method, and provide
    its return value as a fixture, which is always evaluated after all other
    fixtures (so they can still be used for setup). The args passed in this
    function call can be customized by overriding the args/kwargs fixtures.

    Test contexts defined underneath this mixin are free to override
    args/kwargs, and create/override fixtures to setup the environment for the
    function call. This encourages named, well-defined contexts for testing
    the common subject from different viewpoints.

    This pattern also encourages slimmer tests, ideally responsible for testing
    a single aspect of the common subject and named descriptively. The upshot
    of this is all issues can be reported in one test run â€“ as opposed to
    monolith tests, where fixing an issue and re-running the test suite reveals
    the next thing to fix.
